# Krono

A modern, minimalist Android/iOS application using Flutter and Dart. The app serves as a visual journal where users are prompted daily to take a single photo, rate their day (mood), and write a short note. The focus is on clean UI (Material 3), "Card" based design, and nostalgic data visualization.
